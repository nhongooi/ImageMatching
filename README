#Image Recognition

A python command-line interface program to find duplicate image.

It has a function to match through a directory and find all matches above a given 
threshold.

##The type of matches:

#Match		  

Match image to image, regarless of size, and marked as a match if pass a the given 
threshold, <fuzzy>, in a given <PATH>. If given type to search for, which can be  
archive or image, the program will recursively search through a given directory and  
match each found image to another image. If given an archive, images will be extracted to a cache directory for matching. A result will be output with given image paths and match percentage.

#Template

Find if a <template_path> is in a list of image in given <path> and will save the 
matches with a blue box if the template reach the given threshold, <fuzzy>.

Usage:
    {0} match [-s <type>] [-f <fuzzy>] <path> [-r <result_path>]
    {0} template [-f <fuzzy>] <template_path> <path> [-r <result_path>]

    {0} --version
Options:
    -s --search=<type>     file type searched for matching, image(default) or archive
    -f --fuzzy=<fuzzy>     percentage match threshold, 100 is default
    -r --return=<return>   path to print result, cwd is default
