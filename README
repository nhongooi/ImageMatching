#Image Recognition

A python command-line interface program to find duplicate image.

It has a function to match through a directory and find all matches above a given 
threshold.

##The type of matches:

#Match		  

Match image to image, regarless of size, and marked as a match if pass a the given 
threshold, <fuzzy>, in a given <PATH>. If given type to search for, which can be  
archive or image, the program will recursively search through a given directory and  
match each found image to another image. If given an archive, images will be extracted to a 
cache directory for matching. A result will be output with given image paths and match percentage.

#Template

Find if a <template_path> is in a list of image in given <path> and will save the 
matches with a blue box if the template reach the given threshold, <fuzzy>.   
 
 #Hashing 
 
 This match image by convert the image into a greyscale 8 by 8 with antialias filtering,  perform a hashing
 algorithm listed within the hash functions below. If the hash value are the same, the images are consider
 the same image. There has been variation of similar images accounted, This algorithm is more strict than
 simple matching, but still allows some variability. An example would be a picture with an a person eating
 comparing to closing their mouth.

Options:
    -s --search=<type>    file type searched for matching, image(default) or archive
    -f --fuzzy=<fuzzy>     percentage match threshold, 100 is default
    -r --return=<return>   path to print result, cwd is default
    -a --hashfunc=<hashfunc>   choose a type of hash algorithm in list bellow
