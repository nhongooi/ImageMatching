# Image Recognition
## An image similarly identifier
#Proposal
This project would implement an analysis program that would identify between two 
images of they have any likelyhood of being similar or the same. It is not to find 
exactly identical images with same dimension, same color space, metadata, or file 
formating. The program should be able to find similarity with different dimension, 
color space, or any augmentation that still retains an image pictoral properties. A 
sample list of augmentation is crop, invert, rotation, and blur. The program will 
identify the differences between two image, give back a result of the differences in 
percentage. 
#Use case
This would be use to find duplicate or very similar image in order to remove or 
reorganize a person's image collection.

My use case is to find duplicate comics within my database. Since there are comics 
that are single chapter and another comics that could contain that chapter, this can 
be use to identify the that aspect of duplication in a collection. The implement of 
pdf extraction and and matching can if I would have multiple documents of something 
in order to clean for space.
#Outcome
The result will be the directory in a text file
